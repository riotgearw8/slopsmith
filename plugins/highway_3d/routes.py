"""Plugin-registered FastAPI routes for the 3dhighway visualization plugin.

Registered by slopsmith core via plugin.json's "routes" field — the
loader at plugins/__init__.py:589–604 imports this module and calls
setup(app, context). context["config_dir"] points at the slopsmith
data directory; we namespace user uploads under
{config_dir}/plugin_uploads/highway_3d/.

This module owns the upload/serve/delete endpoints for the `video` bg
style (issue #19 follow-up). Single deterministic slot — each upload
replaces the previous file, no orphan accumulation. localStorage on
the renderer side stores only the filename, never the bytes.
